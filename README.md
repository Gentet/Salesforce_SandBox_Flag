## Chrome Extension - Salesforce Sandbox Flag
================

This tool updates the small black Sandbox flags in Salesforce to become a banner that spans the top of the page and follows as you scroll.

This __should__ stop users from accidentaly making edits in the wrong Sandbox, or in better scenarios, it should stop users from making edits in a production instance.

**To install**

To install this Extenstion you will need to do the following:

1) Download all files and place them in a folder with nothing else.

2) Navigate to **chrome://extensions/**.

3) Drag the **src** folder onto the page.

4) Enjoy!

**Bugs**
- None that I know of.
